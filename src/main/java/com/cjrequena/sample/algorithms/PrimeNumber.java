 * A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number

 * A simple but slow method of checking the primality of a given number n, called trial division, tests whether n is a multiple of any

 *
 * Faster algorithms include the Millerâ€“Rabin primality test, which is fast but has a small chance of error, and the AKS primality test,
 * which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical.
